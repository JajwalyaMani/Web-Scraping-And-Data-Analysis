# Web-Scraping-And-Data-Analysis

### What is web scraping?
Web scraping is a technique for **targeted, automated extraction of information from websites.**

Similar extraction can be done manually but it is usually faster, more efficient and less error-prone to automate the task.

Web scraping allows you to acquire non-tabular or poorly structured data from websites and convert it into a usable, structured format, such as a .csv file or spreadsheet.

Scraping is about more than just acquiring data: it can also help you archive data and track changes to data online.

###### For example:

- Online stores will periodically scour the publicly available pages of their competitors, scrape item names and prices and   then use this information to adjust their own prices.
- Marketing databases may be compiled by scraping contact information such as email addresses.

###### Applications of scraping in research and journalism may include:

- tracking trends in the real estate market by scraping data from real estate web sites
- collecting online article comments and other discourse for analysis (e.g. using text mining)
- gathering data on membership and activity of online organisations
- collecting archives of reports from many web pages
The practice of data journalism, in particular, relies on the ability of investigative journalists to harvest data that is not always presented or published in a form that allows analysis.

#### Web scraping therefore involves:

- telling a computer how to navigate through a web site to find required content (sometimes called spidering); and
- providing patterns with which the computer can identify and extract required content.

# The Task
